# Incentives

## Raid Performance

Performance rankings will be throughout the week (Tues-Mon) and incentives based on those rankings will be effective in the next lockout.

**DPS**: Based on bracket rankings from [Warcraft Logs](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/guild/us/grobbulus/cry%20havoc). Incentives are granted to the top 5 performers in the form of roll buffs which can be used when rolling on an SR (not open rolls). Top 3 players can trade 1 SR for an HR in addition to the roll buff.

**Healers**: TBD

**Tanks**: TBD

## Bank Bounties

As the guild quartermaster creates bounties, those that fill the full order will be rewarded a roll buff of `+10` in the next raid. Bounties will be posted in the #guild-bank channel by the quartermaster.
