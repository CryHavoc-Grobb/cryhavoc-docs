# How are we rebuilding for Cata?

This will be broken into 3 phases

## Phase 1 - Storming

### Beginning in pre-patch:

1. **Guild announcements**: Go over incoming changes.
1. **Mass Invites**: Start inviting everyone!
    - Cold-call invites. Send a message to any unguilded over level 60. Ask to invite and then send it.
    - Spam trade
    - Spam Grobb discord
    - While you're leveling and running duneons, just start picking people up.
1. **Rank restructure**
1. **Get discord in sync with new structure if needed**

### As we're leveling:

1. Try not to get too "cliquey" and get into some groups to get to know the rest of the guild. Try to pay attention to them as a player. Do they seem to know what they're doing? Do they seem like someone you wouldn't mind raiding with?
1. Start gauging raider interest and put together 
1. Start figuring out who our tanks and healers are

## Phase 2 - Forming

As people are starting to gear up for pre-raid BiS.

1. Start creating group comps for 10m groups
1. Start figuring out the raid schedules
1. Start incentives for the first raid. For example
    - First few people to 85
    - First few people to 346
    - Figure out how to create some performance competition to get prelim rankings going into T11

## Phase 3 - Norming

After the first month, or once we're starting to work on heroics.

1. Groups become more static
1. Raid leaders locked in
1. Start talking about 25m alt raid
