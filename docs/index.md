# Welcome to Cry Havoc!

Cry Havoc is a gaming group that has been together since before Vanilla Classic. We're a fair mix of casual and skilled players (pink parsers) but lean more towards a relaxed "dad guild" in many respects. Our goal is to provide an environment where "old pros" can come to play without the stress and commitment of a progression guild, but also where semi-casuals can come to do some content as well. 

Like many other guilds, we've been battling the roster boss only being able to field a single 4hr raid per week, but we're looking to re-organize and rebuild in preparation for Cata Classic where our goal is to field a few 10m groups, including at least 1 of those group focused on pushing heroic content. At the same time, we're hoping to also be running a 25 man alt and casual raid.


## Somewhere between "semi-serious" and "semi-casual"

By "semi-serious" we just mean that we aim to be a little more than a "dad guild". We will define it as a list of expectations:

#### What we DO expect

- You understand your main class and are always trying to improve whether that means doing your own researching or taking the advice of players that are performing above you.
- For max-level raids, your gear is always fully enchanted and gemmed
- You show up to raids with consumes (flasks, and food) .
- You show up to raid already knowwing what the general mechanics for the fight are and have at least watched a video for new fights.
- You attend raids regularly, so the group isn't constantly adjusting to itself.
- Understand that you might get called out (but not berrated) for doing something stupid. Take the criticism and move on.
- We want to enjoy ourselves, but we need to make the most of the limited time we spend, so don't be surprised if there are times we seem a bit business-like. As content moves faster (e.g. with gear), things quickly loosen up.
- If you are parsing below median (not at least green), you're going to attract some attention from the council. Note: the expectation will likely be higher for *designated* prog groups.

#### What we do NOT expect

- That you are orange parser every day of every week.
- Be online and active every day.
- Commit most of the week to raiding.
- Getting yelled at.
