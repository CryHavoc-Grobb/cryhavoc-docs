# Guild Ranks

The rank structure is mostly functional, not merit-based. Ranks are arranged around permissions and permissions are arranged around guild function.

## Rank 0 - Guild Master

The guild master is responsible for the general operations of the guild. Some of the responsibilities may include:

- Establishing and communicating the general direction of the guild
- Conflict resolution
- Selection of Officers and Council
- Recruiting

## Rank 1 - Officer

Officers assist the GM with operating the guild by taking on key functions. To do this, officers must have elevated permissions.

### Raid Leaders

Raid leaders are trusted with leading groups through raids. Their responsibilities inlcude:

- Organizing boss strategies. This includes choosing the overall strat, assignments
- Orchestrating the execution of the chosen strategies (i.e. callouts, calling for big cooldowns, etc.)
- Choosing a progression path based on the details of the active raid
- Managing the roster, balancing composition etc.
- Acting as the loot master (when needed)


### Recruiters

Recrtuiters are responsible for filling our ranks and keeping them filled. Responsibilities include:

- In-game recruiting (chat spam, unguilded sniping)
- External recruiting (forums, discord, etc.)
- Keeping the class distribution balanced (for mains)
- Filling gaps in composition, skill, etc.

### Quartermaster

Quartermasters manage the guild bank:

- Keep tabs organized
- Ensure we're keeping stocked up on key consumables and enchant materials
- Placing bounties on items that are running low
- Selling BoE items once we determine they will not be needed by any mains or primary alts.

## Rank 2 - Council

Council members serve at the tactical level to help sure not only that our raiders are performing at the best of their ability, but also that our composition is as optimized as it can be. Additionally, this rank helps inform the GM and raid leads on related issues such as loot, composition, performance, etc. 

- Tanks
- Physical DPS
- Caster DPS
- Healers

Ideally, this rank is filled with our best players, but there will be times where those people simply don't want the commitment. In these cases, we will still aim to fill the spot. The reponsibility remains the same. Role leaders are expected to keeping their players aligned and inform up the chain.

## Rank 3 - Core Raider

Put simply, this rank is filled with our best performing players. Players in this rank are selected to fill heroic prog groups. Rank membership is generally decided by the council based on objective performance (parses) and other subjective inputs such as player skill and attendance.

## Rank 4 - Raider

Guild members that regularly attend raids.

## Rank 5 - Member

All other members of the guild (i.e. casuals, friends and family, etc.)


## Rank 6 - Recruit

Probationary rank.
